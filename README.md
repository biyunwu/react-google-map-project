# Neighbourhood Map

## Intriduction

  This is the final project of my Udacity Front-end Nanodegree program which is offered by Google Scholarship.

  The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and powered by Google Maps and Foursquare APIs.
